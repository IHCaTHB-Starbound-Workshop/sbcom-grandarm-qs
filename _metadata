This mod is an optional patch that requires Quarterstaff Armory and Grand Armory to work.
Running Quarterstaff Armory Extended will add all the extended variations as expected.
If you are running Frackin Universe and not Quarterstaff Extended you will need the Grand Armory-Frackin Universe compatibility patch to utilize the extended assets included in FU.
